My vimrc
============

This repository keeps my vim setup (.vim and vimrc). It was originaly cloned
from Haridas's repository https://github.com/haridas/Dotfiles. Over time I have
mmodified it to suit my own requirements. 

Vim Environment
---------------

Plugins used are:-
1. auto-pairs   
2. Command-T    - Fuzzy file search.
3. minibufexpl  - Show vim buffers on separate virtual tabs.
4. nerdtree     - File browser for vim.
5. nerdcommenter   
6. syntastic    - Syntax checker for different file types.
7. tagbar       - Ctag based File analyzer.

If you are interested to try out my vim setup you can run the following
steps.

How to Install
--------------

1. Clone the repository
2. Inside Dotfiles folder 
   $git submodule update --init --recursive

Note: For Command-T and YouCompleteMe you might have to perform some additional
steps to compile the plugins. PLease refer their respective setups.

Thank you.
